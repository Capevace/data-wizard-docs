<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Custom Strategy">
        Create a class implements the `Strategy` interface.
        Doing so by extending the `Extractor` class is a good starting point for custom strategies as it contains some useful methods that you probably don't want to implement yourself.

        ```php
        use Mateffy\Magic\Extraction\Strategies\Strategy;
        use Mateffy\Magic\Extraction\Strategies\Extractor;

        // Create a custom strategy
        class MyCustomStrategy extends Extractor {}

        // Extend an existing strategy
        class MyCustomizedStrategy extends SequentialStrategy {}

        // Or completely custom by doing everything yourself
        class MyCompletelyCustomStrategy implements Strategy {}
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Implement the Strategy">
        Implement your strategy in the `run()` method, which takes the artifacts as an array.

        The `array` that the run method returns is used as the final output data.

        <CodeGroup>

        ```php New strategy
        use Mateffy\Magic\Extraction\Strategies\Extractor;

        class MyCustomStrategy extends Extractor
        {
            public function run(array $artifacts): array
            {
                // Implement your strategy here
            }
        }
        ```

        ```php Extend an existing strategy
        use Mateffy\Magic\Extraction\Strategies\Extractor;
        use Mateffy\Magic\Exceptions\JsonSchemaValidationError;

        class ValidatedInvoiceStrategy extends ParallelStrategy
        {
            public function run(array $artifacts): array
            {
                $data = parent::run($artifacts);

                // Validate an invoice total:

                $total = 0;

                foreach ($data['line_items'] as $item) {
                    $total += $item['amount'];
                }

                if ($total !== $data['total']) {
                    throw new \JsonSchemaValidationError(
                        'Invoice total does not match the sum of line items'
                    );
                }

                // The returned data is now
                // guaranteed to be valid invoice data.
                return $data;
            }
        }
        ```

        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Register the Strategy">
        Call `Magic::registerStrategy('my-custom-strategy', MyCustomStrategy::class)` in your `boot()` method in the service provider.

        ```php
        class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
        {
            public function register()
            {
                Magic::registerStrategy('my-custom-strategy', MyCustomStrategy::class);
            }
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

Now your custom strategy is usable in the Data Wizard settings UI.
