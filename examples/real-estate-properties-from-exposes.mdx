## Extractor

Here's a template for a real estate exposé extractor with some explanations for why some settings are chosen.

### JSON Schema

Here's the example JSON schema to extract real estate data. It includes information about the property, units, images and floorplans.
The schema also contains validation rules for each field to ensure the extracted data is accurate and consistent.

### Extraction Strategy

#### Strategy: `sequential-auto-merge`
The `sequential-auto-merge` strategy is a good choice for real estate exposés because it processes the document sequentially, retaining context between pages. The auto-merging allows smaller entities like units or images to be merged together more effectively.

#### LLM Recommendation: `google/gemini-2.0-flash`
This model is a good choice for real estate exposés because of its vision capabilities and large context window. It is also relatively cheap to use and provides good performance for data extraction tasks. You can also use `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite` for cost savings.


### Context Settings

#### Chunk Size: `75k`
A chunk size of around 75.000 tokens should be enough to cover most real estate exposés.

#### Include Text: `true`
Including text is essential for extracting textual information from the exposés.

#### Include Embedded Images: `true`
Including embedded images is crucial for associating images with specific units or the property itself. This allows the LLM to understand the context of the images and extract relevant data.

#### Include Page Screenshots: `true`
Page screenshots provide layout context, which is important for the LLM to understand the structure of the exposé and extract data accurately.

#### Mark Images with IDs: `true`
Marking images with IDs is necessary to associate images with data entities (property or units). This ensures that the extracted data includes references to the correct images.
