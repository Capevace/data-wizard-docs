## Extractor

Here's a template for a customer feedback form extractor with specific settings recommendations.

### JSON Schema

Here's a tailored JSON schema for customer feedback forms. It focuses on capturing key feedback elements such as customer details, ratings, and textual feedback.

<Accordion title="Show Customer Feedback Schema">
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "formType": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Type of the form (e.g., Customer Feedback Form)",
      "default": "Customer Feedback Form"
    },
    "submissionDate": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date",
      "description": "Date the form was submitted"
    },
    "customerName": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Full name of the customer"
    },
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email",
      "description": "Email address of the customer"
    },
    "feedbackText": {

    }

}
```
</Accordion>

### Extraction Strategy

#### Strategy: `simple`
For customer feedback forms, the `simple` strategy is generally sufficient. Feedback forms are typically short and focused, making them suitable for single-pass extraction.

#### LLM Recommendation: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite`
`google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite` provides a good balance of cost-effectiveness and performance for processing customer feedback forms. Its vision capabilities are beneficial if handling scanned forms with potentially varied handwriting.

### Context Settings

#### Chunk Size: `25k-50k`
A chunk size of 25.000 to 50.000 tokens should comfortably accommodate most customer feedback forms.

#### Include Text: `true`
Essential for capturing the textual feedback, customer names, and other text-based fields.

#### Include Embedded Images: `false`
Embedded images are unlikely to be relevant in standard feedback forms and can be excluded.

#### Include Page Screenshots: `true`
Page screenshots are recommended, especially for scanned forms. They help the LLM understand the layout and context of different fields, improving accuracy in extracting data from potentially less structured forms.

#### Mark Images with IDs: `false`
Not needed for typical customer feedback extraction.
