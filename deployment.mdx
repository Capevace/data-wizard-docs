## Updating Data Wizard

When updating Data Wizard, you can pull the latest Docker image and restart the container. Make sure to back up your data before updating to prevent data loss.

```bash
docker pull mateffy/data-wizard:latest
docker stop data-wizard
docker rm data-wizard
docker run ... (same run command as before)
```

You may need to change `data-wizard` to your docker container name if you have changed it or are using a random name.

## Migrating the Database

You may need to migrate the database when updating to a new version of Data Wizard. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it data-wizard php artisan migrate
```

With container ID:
```bash
docker exec -it <container-id> php artisan migrate
```
