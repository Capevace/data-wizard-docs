## What is Data Wizard?

**TLDR**:

- Data Wizard allows you to efficiently extract structured data from unstructured documents.
- It does so using Large Language Models (LLMs).
- It is built to work with basically any kind of document format or extraction use case.
- You can use Data Wizard as a standalone tool or integrate it into your applications.
- Data Wizard is open-source and free to use.


Data Wizard is an open-source tool designed to simplify and automate the extraction of structured data from unstructured documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). In today's digital landscape, valuable information is often locked away in PDFs, scanned forms, and other document formats that are difficult for computers to process. Data Wizard bridges this gap, transforming these documents into machine-readable JSON data, ready for integration into your systems and workflows.

    LLM[LLM Config] -- Prompt & Strategy --> Extraction
    Output[Output format] -- JSON Schema --> Extraction
    Extraction --> Results[Extracted and validated JSON data]
```

</p>


Imagine you have a collection of PDF invoices and need to get the data into your accounting software. Manually typing out each invoice is time-consuming and error-prone. **Data Wizard solves this problem.**  Simply upload your invoices, configure a few settings, and Data Wizard will intelligently extract the key information like invoice numbers, dates, line items, and totals, delivering it to you in a structured JSON format.

But Data Wizard is more than just a simple PDF to JSON converter. It's a **flexible and powerful platform** built for developers and businesses seeking to harness the intelligence of LLMs for data extraction in a variety of contexts.
