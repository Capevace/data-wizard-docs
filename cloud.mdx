description: Use our experience running Data Wizard by paying for a hosted version of the service.

<Warning>
    The cloud hosting service is currently in development and not yet available. Please check back later for updates. For now, you can use the [Docker Container](./quick-start) to run Data Wizard on your own infrastructure.

    If you're very interested in this, [contact me directly](mailto:hey@mateffy.me) and we can see if we can work something out.
