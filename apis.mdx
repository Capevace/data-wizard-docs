description: 'Integrate Data Wizard programmatically using the HTTP REST API and GraphQL API endpoints.'
---


For more advanced integration scenarios or applications requiring deeper control over the data extraction process, Data Wizard provides both **HTTP REST API** and **GraphQL API** endpoints. These APIs allow you to interact with Data Wizard programmatically, without relying on the embedded iFrame UI.

## API Endpoints and Authentication

Data Wizard's API is built using API Platform for Laravel, providing automatically generated endpoints and documentation based on your data models.

*   **API Documentation:** Access the interactive API documentation at `https://YOUR_DATA_WIZARD_URL/api/` (replace `YOUR_DATA_WIZARD_URL` with your Data Wizard instance URL). This documentation is generated using the OpenAPI specification and allows you to explore available endpoints, request/response schemas, and even test API calls directly in your browser.

*   **Authentication:** The API is secured using Laravel Sanctum, which provides token-based authentication.

    1.  **Generate API Tokens:**  Log in to your Data Wizard backend as a superadmin and navigate to the "Settings" page. Find the "API Tokens" section and generate new API tokens.
    2.  **Include Token in Requests:**  When making API requests, include your API token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
        ```

## REST API Endpoints

The REST API provides standard HTTP endpoints for interacting with Data Wizard resources. Key endpoints include:

*   **Buckets:**
    *   `POST /api/buckets`: Create a new Extraction Bucket.
    *   `GET /api/buckets`: List all Extraction Buckets.
    *   `GET /api/buckets/{id}`: Retrieve a specific Extraction Bucket.
    *   `DELETE /api/buckets/{id}`: Delete an Extraction Bucket.
*   **Extractors:**
    *   `POST /api/saved_extractors`: Create a new Extractor (SavedExtractor).
    *   `GET /api/saved_extractors`: List all Extractors.
    *   `GET /api/saved_extractors/{id}`: Retrieve a specific Extractor.
    *   `PUT /api/saved_extractors/{id}`: Update an Extractor.
    *   `DELETE /api/saved_extractors/{id}`: Delete an Extractor.
*   **Extraction Runs:**
    *   `POST /api/extraction_runs`: Start a new Extraction Run.
    *   `GET /api/extraction_runs`: List all Extraction Runs.
    *   `GET /api/extraction_runs/{id}`: Retrieve a specific Extraction Run.
    *   `GET /api/extraction_runs/{id}/results`: Retrieve results of an Extraction Run.

## GraphQL API Endpoint

Data Wizard also exposes a GraphQL endpoint for more flexible data querying.

*   **GraphQL Endpoint URL:** `https://YOUR_DATA_WIZARD_URL/api/graphql`

*   **GraphQL Queries:**  GraphQL allows you to specify exactly the data you need in your queries, reducing over-fetching and improving efficiency.

**Example GraphQL Query (List Extractors and their Labels):**

```graphql
query {
  savedExtractors {
    collection {
      id
      label
    }
  }
}
```

**Using GraphQL Clients:**

You can use GraphQL clients in your programming language of choice to interact with the GraphQL API. Popular clients include:

*   **Apollo Client (JavaScript):** For React and other JavaScript applications.
*   **Relay (JavaScript):**  Another popular GraphQL client for React.
*   **GraphQL clients for Python, Java, etc.:** Libraries are available for most programming languages.

## Programmatic Data Extraction Workflow

Using the HTTP or GraphQL API, you can automate your data extraction workflow:

1.  **Create a bucket:**  Create a new bucket and embed or redirect users to upload files using the embeddable URL of the bucket.
3.  **Monitor Extraction Status:**  Periodically check the status of the Extraction Run using the API to track its progress.
4.  **Retrieve Results:** Once the Extraction Run is complete, retrieve the extracted data in JSON, XML, or CSV format using the API.
5.  **Integrate Data:**  Process and integrate the extracted data into your application or data pipelines.
